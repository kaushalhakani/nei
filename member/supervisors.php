<p>Dr. Hoberman is a European cultural and intellectual historian with special interests in Sportwissenschaft and the history of ideas about race. He has also done extensive research on sports doping and the intersection of sports, politics, science, public opinion and the Olympics. He has published almost a hundred sports commentaries in American newspapers and magazines and in Der Spiegel. Dr. Hoberman has taught courses on sport and politics at Harvard University, the University of Chicago, and The University of Texas at Austin, where he is a Professor of Germanic Languages with a specialty in Scandinavian studies, including Norwegian language instruction. At the University of Texas he has given two graduate seminars on two Scandinavian authors: the Danish writers Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen) and S?ren Kierkegaard. In the area of German cultural studies, he has given graduate seminars on "Ernst J?nger and the Modern Age" and "Germans and Jews in Central Europe." He has a special interest in the history of racial folklore about Jews, and his current book-in-progress is Kafka's Body: Masculinity, Sport, and the Jews.
