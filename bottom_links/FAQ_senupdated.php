  <strong><li>What is NEI? Is it a university or group of institutions?</li></strong>
  <p>NEI (Network of engineering institutions) is a group of 4 Elite institutions of the country founded to to promote cutting edge research in the field of VLSI for achieving indigenous chip designing and fabrication capabilities in India.</p>
  <strong><li>What are its objectives?</li></strong>
    <p>The main objective of NEI is to form a network of engineering education institutions, which can cooperate towards enhancing research activities at Ph.D. level, initially in the area of VLSI, but with a view to expand it in other areas and to Provide a means of guidance to research and project students through an expert/mentor panel.</p>
  <strong><li>Which colleges are part of  NEI?</li></strong>
    <p>At present, there are 4 Elite institutions of the country are members of NEI . they are  :: <br /> 1.  Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DAIICT), Gandhinagar <br /> 2.   Mody Institute of Technology and Science, Lakshmangarh <br /> 3.   Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering (YCCE), Meghe Group of Institutions, Nagpur <br /> 4.   The LNM Institute of Information Technology (LNMIIT), Jaipur.</p>  

  <strong><li>Is NEI only for research students?</li></strong>
   <p>No, apart from helping the research students , it also offers workshop for B.tech or graduating students.</p>
   <strong><li>In which Courses workshop is offered?</li></strong>
    <p>To be answered............</dd>
  <strong><li>What are the structure of workshop?</li></strong>
  <p>Workshop is offered in three types of courses <br /> Type 1   :: courses, which are Foundation courses typically in the areas of Physics and mathematics run by experts. <br /> type 2     ::courses, which are specialized courses run by the mentor panel <br /> type 3     ::courses, which are presentations made by the Research Scholars on the basis of topics or papers assigned by the Mentors.</p>
    Each of the Workshops  runs over ten working days, constituting a total of 60 hours. 36 of these hours would be devoted to Type 2 courses and 12 to Foundation (Type 1) Courses. The lectures would be typically of 1-hour duration.Type 3 courses involving the presentations by research scholars would be scheduled for four hours would be treated as a module; thus one Full Type 2 Course would require 3 modules. </p>
 
  <strong><li>When and Where NEI organizes workshop?</li></strong>
    <p>Workshops is  planned annually, Typically a set of two 10 working- day  distributed in location among the Engineering College Network. </p>
	<strong><li>I am a B.Tech student in other insttitutions , can i join the workshop?</li></strong>
    <p>To be answered..... </p>
<strong><li>What is the procedure to enroll in Phd?</li></strong>
    <p>To be answered.... </p>
	<strong><li>What is the Eligibility to enroll in Phd?</li></strong>
   <p>Those Students who have qualified for entry into any one of the colleges in the Network are eligible to enroll in the program  To qualify for the network program, the student would be required in addition to pass a qualifying exam set by the Mentor Panel. While he would be given this opportunity thrice, failure to do so will not cancel his enrolment in the PhD program of the parent college – he will merely not qualify for the Network PhD program. University must agree to the registration of the area and not the title. Industry sponsored candidates and part timers will also be follow similar selection procedures but will require registration at university that may not require residency.  </p>
   <strong><li>What is the course work during the program?</li></strong>
    <p>During his PhD period, the scholar will be required to take three types of courses. These courses may not require presence of the student on campus for prolonged durations. The registration decision for such courses would be decided by the local supervisor at the host institution in consultation with the Mentor Panel if need be.</p>
<p>Type 1: these courses include two domains -Mathematics and Physics. Mathematics includes Digital Signal Processing, Graph Theory and Linear Algebra. Physics includes Electromagnetic theory, Solid state Physics and Thermodynamics.</p>
<p>These can be offered through workshop participation or if the host institute is offering any of these courses, the student can pursue the course with the respective institute. The student has to complete minimum 6 modules of this type.</p> 	
<p>Type 2: courses would be through the Workshop series. A student would be required to attend a minimum of 2 such workshops, and appear for a test set up by the Instructor. Workshop attendance and subsequent evaluation may substitute the course requirement which has to taken for fulfilment of this program.</p>
<p>Type 3: courses would be a set of readings of published papers, some foundational and some recent, designated by the Guide and titled “Selected Readings”. The evaluation of the same would again usually be during a workshop in the Workshop Series. Typically, this would involve a presentation by the scholar to the guide and /or designated Mentor Panel members.</p>
<strong><li>Is there any scholarship offered by NEI?</li></strong>
     <p>In the initial phase of NEI, no extra scholarship will be provided to the PhD students. However, travel money to attend the Workshop would be provided to both the Research Scholar, (provided he is an employee or a full-time research scholar at the Institution) and his local Supervisor by the Parent Institution and attendance and local hospitality would be provided by the Institution hosting the Workshop. In addition, travel for the Research Scholar to visit his Mentor would be provided once a year. ,  </p>
