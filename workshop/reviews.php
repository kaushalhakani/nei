<h2>Course Contents</h2>

1. Physics of Semiconductor Devices (Lecture - 18 hours):
Band theory, Continuity equation, P-N junction: zero and reverse bias, forward bias, capacitance, Metalsemiconductor
contacts, MOS capacitor, BJTs & MOSFETs.
2. CMOS Analog Circuit Design (Lecture - 35 hours, Lab - 15 hours):
The main objective of this course is to learn how to analyze and design CMOS analog amplifier circuits.
The emphasis will be on circuit design, and in every phase of the course, the learner will be expected to design, on
paper as well as in simulation, the circuits discussed in the lectures.
This course will broadly cover the following topics: MOS transistors: physics, modeling and layout;
Common-source amplifier: current source load, diode load, frequency response, design; Cascode amplifier,
Common-gate and common-drain amplifiers; Differential amplifier: dc and ac analysis, design; Current mirrors:
basic, cascode, active, advanced; Opamps: one stage, two stage, CMFB, design; Stability and compensation,
Parameter variations, Advanced amplifiers: high slew-rate, rail-to-rail, low power; Advanced Topics: D/A
Converters, Types of Noise and its statistical characteristics, circuit representation, introduction to RF Design.
