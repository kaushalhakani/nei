<h2>Workshop Series:</h2>
<p>To promote the idea, every year the NEI will organize two workshops on specialized areas of VLSI designing and semiconductor technology.</p>
<ol>
<li> Visit <b><a href="workshop_new.html">New Workshops</a></b> to see current Workshops 
<li> General workshop calendar and schedule:
<br>		Typically a set of two 10 working- day Workshops would be planned annually, distributed in location among the Engineering College 			Network. </br></li></ol> 
</br>
<b>Program Structure:</b>
<br><br>
There would be three types of Course running in the Program <br>
<a href="Type1.html">Type 1</a> courses, which are Foundation courses typically in the areas of Physics and mathematics run by experts, <br>
<a href="Type2.html">Type 2</a> courses, which are specialized courses run by the mentor panel, and <br>
<a href="Type3.html">Type 3</a> courses, which are presentations made by the Research Scholars on the basis of topics or papers assigned by the Mentors.
<br><br><b>Lecture Modules:</b> </ br> 
<br>Each of the Workshops would run over ten working days, constituting a total of 60 hours. <br />
<ol>
<li> 36 of these hours would be devoted to<a href="Type2.html"> Type 2</a> courses and <br /></li>
<li> 12 to Foundation (<a href="Type1.html">Type 1</a>) Courses. {The lectures would be typically of 1-hour duration.} <br /></li>
<li> <a href="Type3.html">Type 3</a> courses involving the presentations by research scholars would be scheduled for four hours would be treated as a module. Thus one Full <a href="Type2.html">Type 2</a> Course would require 3 modules. <br /></li>
<li> Design Discussion: <br /></li>
Of the remaining 8 hours, four hours would be devoted to Design Discussion sessions, specifically targeting students of the Engineering College Network.<br />
</ol>
<p>In some cases, members from Industry could be invited to participate in these discussion sessions. In these Design Discussion sessions, participating students at the B.Tech, M.Tech and PhD levels would be invited to present their designs to be evaluated and guided by the expert panels. 
</p>
PhD student would be required to cover 8 modules for the equivalent of a single course, and would be required to pass an exam set by the module presenter for qualification. <br>
<br>
<b>PhD Mentoring:</b> The remaining four hours would be devoted to mentoring and guidance for and/or presentations by the PhD students. The PhD scholars would have the opportunity to present their selected readings as part of <a href="Type3.html">Type 3</a> courses, present Thesis Proposals or have discussions with the experts present or with peers working at different locations. <br>
<br>
Student will enrol at his home institution under the regular Ph.D. program. In addition to the Ph.D. degree requirements set by the (home) institution,the student will also have to satisfy NEI's requirements: During his PhD period, the scholar will be required to take three types of courses. These courses may not require presence of the student on campus for prolonged durations. The registration decision for such courses would be decided by the local supervisor at the host institution in consultation with the Mentor Panel if need be. <br><br><br>
