<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Network of Engineering Institutions (NEI) has been founded with a collaborative effort of the participating institutions, to promote cutting edge research in the field of VLSI for achieving indigenous chip designing and fabrication capabilities in India. The cooperative research program envisages a network of engineering colleges, universities and other institutes, coupled to a networked panel of experts, who would be responsible for continuous monitoring and guidance of the research program.</p>

<h2>Objectives of NEI</h2>
<ol>
<li> To form a network of engineering education institutions, which can cooperate towards enhancing research activities at Ph.D. level, initially in the area of VLSI, but with a view to expand it in other areas.</li>
<li>Provide a means of guidance to research and project students through an expert/mentor panel.</li>
<li>Create a peer group of research students for exchange of ideas, expertise and experience. </li>
<li>Enable available resources for research purposes.</li>
</ol>

<p>The NEI is formed with a network of engineering colleges and Universities coupled to a networked panel of experts, who are responsible for continuous monitoring and guidance of the Research Program. A distinctive feature of the program is a series of workshops, referred as the “Workshop Series”. The program is run by an Executive Committee comprising of Members of the College Network as well as members of the Mentor Panel and financed jointly by the members of the College Network.</p>

<h3>The program consists of four key features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, it seeks to form a panel of experts (the Mentor Panel) in the VLSI area who would continuously monitor, guide, mentor and evaluate research in the country. This should guarantee the quality of research.</li>
<li>Secondly, it seeks to network a set of colleges which would actively participate in the program. For this purpose, a set of Rules and Regulations have been formulated to ensure compatibility and smooth functioning of the activities of the Project.</li>
<li>Thirdly, to combat the paucity of teachers, and the lack of significant PhD level courses, it seeks to conduct a series of workshops with the panel of experts. The Workshop Series would serve multiple purposes. It would serve as a basis for course work for PhD scholars; it would provide a forum for the panel of experts for continuous mentoring; it would be able a channel for evaluation of design projects at the B.Tech and M.Tech levels and subsequent possible fabrication, testing and evaluation thus assuring continuing growth pattern.</li>
<li>Finally, the formation of peer group among scholars will facilitate interchange of ideas and expertise. This  is proposed to be done by  Internet Communication Facility which would serve not only as a base for exchange and clarification of ideas, but also as a Resource Center for obtaining help on use of sophisticated tools, assistance in journal article search, and for networking with undergraduate and postgraduate students.</li>
</ul>
