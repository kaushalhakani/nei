<ol>
	<li>Prof. S.C.Sahasrabuddhe, DAIICT</li>
	<li>Prof. A. Kapur, YCCE</li>
	<li>Prof. P. K. Das, MITS</li>
	<li>Prof. R. Gangopadhyay, LNMIIT</li>
</ol>

<h2>Regulations for Participating Institutions</h2>
<ol>
	<li>An Executive Committee is to be formed, which will consist of Representatives of the participating institutions and nominated members of the Mentor 	Panel. The Executive Committee members would rotate periodically.</li>
	<li>Local expenses for the Activities would be borne by the Local Participating Institution.</li>
	<li>For all Events, the nominal budget would be shared among the Participating Institutions. However, any credit or debit beyond the nominal budget generated through the event e.g. due to outside participation would be credited or debited to the Host Institution.</li>
	<li>The Participating Institutions would jointly seek alternate methods of funding the activities and Events.</li> 
	<li>Every participating institution has to issue a standard transcript form, which will be accepted by all the mentors and other participating institutions.</li> 
	<li>Every institution has to provide local guidance to the students enrolled in the course through that institution.</li>
	<li>Every institute has to appoint a Local Technical committee, who will be responsible for conducting activities at the host institute.</li>
	<li>The Participating Institute must remain a part of the NEI as long as there is any student from that institute pursuing a degree affiliated with the NEI.</li>
</ol>
                 
<h2>Regulations for Research Scholars participating in the Program</h2> 

<ol>
	<b><li>Eligibility and Enrolment:</b>  Students eligible to enroll in the program would be students who have qualified for entry into any one of the colleges in the Network. To qualify for the network program, the student would be required in addition to pass a qualifying exam set by the Mentor Panel.  While he would be given this opportunity thrice, failure to do so will not cancel his enrolment in the PhD program of the parent college – he will merely not qualify for the Network PhD program. University must agree to the registration of the area and not the title. Industry sponsored candidates and part timers will also be follow similar selection procedures but will require registration at university that may not require residency.</li></br>
	
    <b><li>Guide Selection Process:</b> Once qualified, the student will be given an opportunity to travel and meet the members of the Mentor Panel. In a given time frame, the student will be required to form an association with a PhD guide/s – typically a six-month period. The other guide must be from the Participating Institution or their nominee.</li></br>

	<b><li>Course Work during the Program:</b> During his PhD period, the scholar will be required to take three types of courses. These courses may not require presence of the student on campus for prolonged durations. The registration decision for such courses would be decided by the local supervisor at the host institution in consultation with the Mentor Panel if need be.</li>
	<ul>
    	<b><li>Type 1:</b> these courses include two domains -Mathematics and Physics. Mathematics includes Digital Signal Processing, Graph Theory and Linear Algebra. Physics includes Electromagnetic theory, Solid state Physics and Thermodynamics. These can be offered through workshop participation or if the host institute is offering any of these courses, the student can pursue the course with the respective institute. The student has to complete minimum 6 modules of this type.</li>
		<b><li>Type 2:</b> courses would be through the Workshop series. A student would be required to attend a minimum of 2 such workshops, and appear for a test set up by the Instructor. Workshop attendance and subsequent evaluation may substitute the course requirement which has to taken for fulfilment of this program.</li>  
     	<b><li>Type 3:</b> courses would be a set of readings of published papers, some foundational and some recent, designated by the Guide and titled “Selected Readings”. The evaluation of the same would again usually be during a workshop in the Workshop Series. Typically, this would involve a presentation by the scholar to the guide and /or designated Mentor Panel members.</li>
     	</ul></br>
         
	<b><li>Scholarship:</b> In the initial phase of NEI, no extra scholarship will be provided to the PhD students. However, travel money to attend the Workshop would be provided to both the Research Scholar, (provided he is an employee or a full-time research scholar at the Institution) and his local Supervisor by the Parent Institution and attendance and local hospitality would be provided  by the Institution hosting the Workshop. In addition, travel for the Research Scholar to visit his Mentor would be provided once a year.</li></br>

	<b><li>Grade award and Transfer:</b>For those who have taken Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 courses the grades will be awarded during the workshop, by the corresponding Instructor/Mentor. The grades will be submitted to the host institution's administrative office, and then grades will be subsequently sent to the administrative offices of the corresponding student's parent institutions.</li></br>

	<b><li>Comprehensive Exam:</b>Students registered in the PhD program under NEI must pass a comprehensive examination designed to test the overall comprehension of the student in the relevant subjects.</li>
	
    <ol>
		<li>Students admitted with B Tech or M. Sc degrees may appear in the comprehensive examination on completion of Type 1 and Type 2 course requirements. These students will normally be required to take 2 Type 1 course and 4 type 2 courses. Students admitted with M Tech or equivalent degrees will normally be required to take one Type 1 course and two type 2 courses.</li>
    	<li>Students should have a minimum CPI decided by the Mentor Panel.</li>
    	<li>The examination will contain oral and/or written part. The Expert panel will be responsible for setting the comprehensive examination for all eligible Ph D students every semester and will be administered by the Host Institution during a Workshop.</li> 
    	<li>When a student has not passed the comprehensive examination in his/her first attempt, a second comprehensive examination will be conducted by the same board.</li>
    	<li>A student will have to discontinue the Ph D program, if he/she fails to pass the comprehensive examination even in three attempts.</li>
    	<li>A student enrolled in the Ph D program is formally admitted to the candidacy for the Ph D degree after he/she has passed the comprehensive examination.		</li>  
	</ol></br>

	<b><li>Thesis Proposal:</b>  The Scholar would also be required to make a thesis proposal presentation to the Guide and selected members of the Mentor Panel on completion of most of the course work. The Mentor Panel would evaluate the proposal not only in terms of technical content but also in terms of feasibility in terms of available resources required for the research. It may additionally sanction and plan for purchase of research tools required for the research. It would also suggest or modify the list of members amongst the Panel Members deemed suitable for continuous guidance, mentoring and evaluation of the Research work, and assist in forming a network of peers carrying out related research.</li></br>

	<b><li>Thesis Evaluation:</b>   The thesis would be evaluated by one member from the Mentor Panel other than the Supervisor. Additional evaluations by other examiners may be decided by the Parent Institution.</li>
